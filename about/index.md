## Bio
My Chinese name is Xueyou Luo, and now I am an NLP engineer in a start-up company called [eigen](https://www.eigentech.ai/en/).

I believe machine learning technology will re-invent the way how human and machine interact. It will eventually change the way we live to be more efficient and competent, and that is what I am passionate about.

Specialties: 
* Python
* C++
* NLP
* Machine learning 
* Deep learning(especially RNN and S2S)
